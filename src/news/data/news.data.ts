        'EU secures compromise on Russian oil ban; Kremlin claims it now controls a third of key Donbas city',
      content:
        'The European Union has agreed on a plan to block more than two-thirds of Russian oil imports as part of new punitive measures against the Kremlin. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the move would effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the bloc by the end of the year. The EU has also agreed on sanctions to cut Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, from the SWIFT messaging system and to ban three more state-owned broadcasters. Meanwhile, Russia has claimed it now controls one-third of the city of Sievierodonetsk as the Kremlin’s troops continue their offensive in the Donbas region.',

        'Biden vows to ‘continue to push’ for gun laws after visiting Uvalde',
      content:
        'As mourners in Uvalde, Tex., prepared to bury 19 children and two teachers, elected officials vowed Monday to examine last week’s elementary school massacre and the flawed police response, and drive changes to gun laws. President Biden, who spent nearly four hours Sunday visiting with the families of Uvalde victims, told reporters he would not give up on efforts to achieve “common-sense” gun legislation. “The folks who were victimized, their families, they spent three hours and 40 minutes with me. They waited all that time. Some came two hours early,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “The pain is palpable. I think a lot of it is unnecessary. I’m going to continue to push.” Biden visits Uvalde, a city in mourning Meanwhile, the chairwoman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime called for hearings on Capitol Hill to give families a chance to tell their stories, and to seek ways to prevent mass shootings. “We will look comprehensively at Uvalde and the incident that occurred last Tuesday,” said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.), whose Houston-based district is several hours from Uvalde and Robb Elementary School, the site of the shootings. Jackson Lee attended church with the president and first lady Jill Biden in Uvalde on Sunday.',

      title: 'Handgun freeze in Canada and five-round limit on magazines',
      content:
        'Canada’s government is to legislate for a national freeze on handgun ownership that would prevent people buying and selling them anywhere in the country.  “The day this legislation goes into effect it will no longer be possible to buy, sell, transfer or import handguns in Canada,” said the prime minister, Justin Trudeau.  The government will also require long-gun magazines to be permanently altered so they can never hold more than five rounds, and will ban the sale and transfer of large capacity magazines.  Seized firearms are displayed during a Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Crime Stoppers news conference at Royal Canadian Mounted Police headquarters in Surrey, British Columbia, on Monday, May 17, 2021. The British Columbia government is providing $200,000 to Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers to try and help police make arrests and solve gang-related crimes after a recent increase in gang-related shootings in the region. The funding will go towards reviving the "guns and gangs" advertising campaign for one-year. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP) Is the US’s gun problem becoming Canada’s gun problem? Read more “Other than using firearms for sport shooting and hunting, there is no reason anyone in Canada should need guns in their everyday lives,” Trudeau said.  If passed, the freeze on handguns is expected to come into force in the autumn. Canada’s public safety minister had tabled regulatory amendments in parliament to ensure it can be implemented swiftly, a ministry statement said.  The killing of 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Texas in the United States has fed concern about gun violence worldwide. Canada already has significantly stronger gun ownership restrictions than its neighbour to the south.  The new legislation, Bill C-21, also proposes taking away the firearms licences of those involved in acts of domestic violence or criminal harassment, such as stalking.',

      title: 'Russian advances in Ukraine’s east mark a tipping point',
      content:
        'For Ukrainians, the news from the front lines is not encouraging. As the 100th day since Russia launched its invasion nears, the tide of battle in Ukraine’s east seems to be pulling in Moscow’s favor. On Monday, Russian troops entered the outskirts of Severodonetsk, one of the last strategically significant cities in the Luhansk region still in Ukrainian control. Should the city fall, it would give Russia and its proxy forces de facto authority over half of Donbas, the country’s coveted eastern industrial heartland.    In a recent interview with a French radio station, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated that the current momentum was part of the Kremlin’s newly focused aim. “Our obvious objective is, of course, to push the Ukrainian army and the Ukrainian battalions out of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,” he said, amid rising fears among Western officials that Russia intends to annex territory in Donbas and Kherson, a region abutting already annexed Crimea.    The Russian advance has been characterized by the same brutality and relentlessness of previous offensives. Observers report similar tactics to those deployed in the conquest of the port city of Mariupol, with endless days and nights of artillery fire and missile strikes pulverizing urban areas.    “They’re just raining down metal on us,” a Ukrainian soldier wounded in the fighting told my colleagues. Eyewitnesses spoke of the stench of death stalking the streets as early summer temperatures rise.    The Russians “use the same tactics over and over again. They shell for several hours — for three, four, five hours — in a row and then attack,” Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, told Reuters. “Those who attack die. Then shelling and attack follow again, and so on until they break through somewhere.”',

        'KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (AP) — Russian troops pushed deeper into a key eastern Ukrainian city Monday, fighting street by street with Kyiv’s forces in a battle that has left Sievierodonetsk in ruins. In a bid to pressure Moscow to end the war, the European Union agreed to embargo most Russian oil imports by the end of the year.    As Moscow’s advance on Sievierodonetsk increased in intensity, Russian forces also shelled parts of Ukraine’s northeast, and a struggle continued for control of a southern region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Russia has prevented the export of 22 million tons of Ukrainian grain, contributing to a growing global food crisis.    Military analysts described the fight for Sievierodonetsk as part of a race against time for the Kremlin. The city is important to Russian efforts to quickly complete the capture of the eastern industrial region of the Donbas before more Western arms arrive to bolster Ukraine’s defense. Moscow-backed separatists already held territory in the region and have been fighting Ukrainian troops for eight years.    “The Kremlin has reckoned that it can’t afford to waste time and should use the last chance to extend the separatist-controlled territory because the arrival of Western weapons in Ukraine could make it impossible,” Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said.

The relevant decisions have already been made. The flags that will be on them are also already clear,” Denis Pushilin said.    Earlier, the head of Russia’s national defence management centre had said that six foreign ships remain in the port of Mariupol: “Princess” (Bulgaria), “Azburg” (Dominican Republic), “Smart” (Liberia), “Blue Star” (Panama), “Azov Concord” (Turkey) and “Lady Augusta” (Jamaica).    TASS reported that Russian Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev said the countries that owned the ships have not taken measures to withdraw them.',

        'In Georgia’s Republican primary, there’s been no shortage of candidates echoing former President Donald Trump’s disproved electoral fraud claims and vowing to restore “election integrity.” Few, however, have what Jake Evans, a Trump-endorsed lawyer making his first run for Congress, is selling: direct experience litigating a 2020 election challenge.     “I contested an election in Long County, Georgia – and that revealed a lot of the widespread fraud we saw in 2020,” Mr. Evans said in a televised debate this month with his GOP primary opponents.     Mr. Evans, who is running in today’s primary for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s old seat in the Atlanta suburbs, represented a Republican probate court judge who sued after losing his primary election by nine votes, claiming fraud.

Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger won their primaries Tuesday despite rejecting Mr. Trump’s entreaties to reverse his 2020 election loss.    It’s a huge warning sign for the way Republican voters view the former president’s crusade to punish those who were not willing to overturn the will of the voters in 2020.    Voters also demonstrated an openness to embracing scandal-plagued candidates – depending on the candidate, and the scandal.    Here are some takeaways from Tuesday’s primary elections in Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, and Minnesota:    Trump’s biggest primary defeat',

        '(1) the voters base their decisions upon facts and not sheer emotionalism, and (2) the candidates have intelligence and integrity.  Neither situation exists in America.     Here’s a depressing thought. There is no solution to our dilemma.  We get to vote, but we can only vote for charlatans.  That is one reason negative campaign ads are so effective; all candidates lack the intelligence and/or the integrity to serve.  Some candidates like LA Mayoral Candidate Rick Caruso are so over the top in their braggadocio, lies, and slander that it is amazing that Angelenos don’t have a visceral reaction to such obnoxious behavior. Rick Caruso, however, is playing the game which LA voters have endorsed for decades: fib, and then lie, and after that concoct gigantic falsehoods. Soon I expect Caruso to take credit for Neil Armstrong’s landing on the moon.     Karen Bass, on the other hand, has not been honest with the voters so she has no integrity.  So what if Caruso opposes abortion as Bass alleges?  Government policy on abortion is not a function of city government.  The city government of Los Angeles is crimogenic cesspool which has taken LA from being the nation’s #1 destination city to being the urban area most shunned.  While Karen Bass has not been in city government, she has been in lock-step with its Omerta which covers city government and the judicial system.  ',

        "BEIJING, May 30 (Reuters) - China will implement new rules on June 30 to govern how agencies that manage celebrities and online influencers operate, the country's broadcasting watchdog said on Monday.    Regulators have blamed these agencies, which are known as multi-channel network (MCN) firms, for fuelling behaviours such as unfettered celebrity worship and fights between fan clubs, often involving minors.    Earlier this month, China ordered internet platforms to step up governance of how under-18s use their livestreaming services as part of an ongoing regulatory crackdown on the booming sector. read more    National Radio and Television Administration said on its website on Monday that MCN firms will need to obtain licenses to operate, follow rules on content and on the types of clients they can manage.    They will also be held accountable for how the fan groups of the celebrities under their wing are managed.    The MCN industry has grown rapidly in China in recent years thanks to the growing popularity of mediums such as livestreaming. In 2020, research consultancy iiMedia Research said there were over 28,000 MCN agencies in China.",
